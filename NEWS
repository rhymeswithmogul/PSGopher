VERSION 1.0.2
Fixes a bug where the content type negotiation fails when the second
character of the URL is not a forward slash.  For example:
 - gopher://example.com/0/textfile.txt -> would work
 - gopher://example.com/0textfile.txt  -> would not have worked

Also, more file types are recognized by the content type guesser, such
as OpenDocument and gemtext documents.

VERSION 1.0.1
There are no user-visible changes.  Only the documentation was updated.

VERSION 1.0.0
PSGopher's first release.
