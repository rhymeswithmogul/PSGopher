VERSION 1.3.2
- The SecureGopher TLS connection information is now shown in the debug
  stream.

VERSION 1.3.1
- Update conceptual help.

VERSION 1.3.0
- The nonstandard sgopher and gopher+tls URL schemes are now supported,
  and will imply the -UseSSL parameter.
- The -TrySSL parameter has been introducted. This will attempt a secure
  connection, but unlike -UseSSL, if a secure connection fails, it will
  fall back to a non-secured one.  (Security-conscious users may want to
  set this as a default parameter in their $PROFILE.)

VERSION 1.2.0
- The non-standard gophers (Gopher + TLS) URL scheme is supported, and
  will imply the -UseSSL parameter.
- You may use query parameters in addition to -InputObject.
- Add more extensions to the type guesser.
- Changed the type guesser to use regular expressions.
- Verbose and Debug preferences are now applied inside helper functions.

VERSION 1.1.1
- Fixes a bug where query strings might be erroneously detected and sent
  to the server, causing resource lookups to fail.

VERSION 1.1
- Adds support for Gopher query strings via the $InputObject parameter.
  Previously, one would have to form their own URL with a query string.

VERSION 1.0.2
- Fixes a bug where the content type negotiation fails when the second
  character of the URL is not a forward slash.  For example:
    - gopher://example.com/0/textfile.txt -> would work
    - gopher://example.com/0textfile.txt  -> would not have worked
- Fixes a bug where non-URL Links were missing from the Links property.
- More file types are recognized by the content type guesser, such as
  OpenDocument and gemtext documents.

VERSION 1.0.1
There are no user-visible changes.  Only the documentation was updated.

VERSION 1.0.0
PSGopher's first release.
